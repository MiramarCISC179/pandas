# pandas

Group Members: Ryan Nesbit and Jeff Nguyen

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the knowledge of the Python Programming Language and data analysis using the pandas library.

We analyzed successful and failed Kickstarter Campaigns using Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib.

We each wrote code separately and added both files into this Github Repository.
